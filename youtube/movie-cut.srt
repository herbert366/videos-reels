1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:06,537
He would have eaten him. He's not
as enlightened as your hip Daddy.

2
00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:09,937
So, you're really okay
with him not being a monster?

3
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:15,370
Human, monster, unicorn,
as long as you're happy.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,470
Thanks, Dad.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,804
<i>And you'll always be my moonlight</i>

6
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:26,504
<i>But now on wings of love you soar</i>

7
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:29,604
<i>Now that you're Johnny's girl</i>

8
00:00:29,704 --> 00:00:33,370
<i>Johnny's girl and kind of Daddy's, too</i>

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,670
<i>Your mom would be so happy
'cause she always knew</i>

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,104
<i>Love is making room
for all the best in you?</i>

11
00:01:02,504 --> 00:01:07,037
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, hey, guys! Todd, take a break.

12
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,137
So, what's up?

13
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,770
Mavis was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go for a fly.

14
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,970
Oh. We haven't done that in forever.
Any special reason?

15
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,670
No special reason at all.

16
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,770
Right, Mavey?

17
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,170
- What's his deal?
- He's silly.

18
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:30,037
It's just a beautiful night, and...
Well, if you don't want to...

19
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:34,504
No, no! Are you kidding? I would eat
a bucket of garlic to fly with you.

20
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:12,370
Oh, honey, look at those fluffy clouds.

21
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,004
Remember what we played
when you were little?

22
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,870
Hide and Go Seek Sharp Objects?

23
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,237
Okay. Regular Hide and Go Seek.

24
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:27,937
Where are you?

25
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:32,070
Honeybat!

26
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,270
Mavey!

27
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:38,370
Honeybat!

28
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:42,104
I'm gonna get you.

29
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,104
Honey? Are you okay?

30
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:53,404
Yes. It's just a little harder
to catch my breath since I'm pregnant.

31
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:57,337
Yes, well, I guess that
would make it more... What?

32
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,604
I'm gonna be a grandpa!

33
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:12,237
And I'm gonna be a dad!

34
00:03:12,904 --> 00:03:15,870
<i>'Cause you're Daddy's girl, or boy</i>

35
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,904
<i>Daddy's girl, or boy</i>

36
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:22,904
I'm hungry again, honey. Can you
get me some ice cream with anchovies?

37
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,270
No, no, no. You mustn't give in to your
cravings. It's not good for the baby.

38
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,070
You need to increase your spider intake,
so he'll be able to climb ceilings properly.

39
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,837
And eat lots of sheep bile.

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,470
I love you, Dad, but we don't even know
if the kid's gonna be a vampire.

41
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,470
I'd be thrilled if the baby's human-y,
just like Johnny.

42
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,204
"Human-y." With thousands of years
of Dracula genes. Not gonna happen.

43
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:52,637
- As long as the baby's healthy.
- Of course. A healthy little vampire.

44
00:03:52,737 --> 00:03:56,637
- Or human.
- Yes, a human who can fly as a bat.

45
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:01,770
Here. Just have some monster ball soup.
It's your mommy's recipe.

46
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:12,237
Thank you, Dad. Just like you made it
when I was a kid. My favorite.

47
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,537
Sorry.

48
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:42,137
Sir, only the father is allowed
in the delivery room.

49
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:47,404
Really? I mean, okay.
He's the family, I guess.

50
00:04:52,437 --> 00:04:55,570
Oh, look! It's a boy! It's a boy!

51
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,037
The Dracula bloodline carries on!

52
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:04,670
No one will ever harm you as long
as I'm here, my little devil dog.

53
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,037
- Dad, can I hold my baby?
- If I were Dad, I'd say yes.

54
00:05:09,137 --> 00:05:14,004
But I'm the nurse, Francine.
Here you go anyway.

55
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,704
My bad.

56
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:29,004
Little Dennis is a year old now.

57
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:35,870
Nice. Yeah. Cute kid.

58
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,170
Okay, time for presents, guys.

59
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,704
All right! Let's do this boy up!

60
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:46,937
Check out what I got him. Bling!

61
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:49,937
- Is it cursed?
- Super cursed.

62
00:05:50,037 --> 00:05:52,904
Only the best. Straight from the crypt.

63
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:57,604
He's just starting to walk,
so maybe it's heavier than...

64
00:05:59,537 --> 00:06:01,604
You're okay, Denisovich.

65
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:04,337
His name is Dennis.
Named after my father.

66
00:06:04,437 --> 00:06:09,104
It's not his vampire name.
My little Denisovichy-Weesovichy.

67
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,770
Are we sure he's a vampire?

68
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,904
I mean, not that it's a bad thing,
but shouldn't he have fangs

69
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:17,704
and that pasty skin you guys have?

70
00:06:17,804 --> 00:06:21,070
Technically, you have until you're five
to get your vampire fangs.

71
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,504
Oh, he'll get his fangs. He's a Dracula.

72
00:06:23,604 --> 00:06:25,537
He's also half Loughran.

73
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:28,804
Maybe he'd be better off where we live.
There's more humans there.

74
00:06:28,904 --> 00:06:33,137
What? Look how well he's playing
with the wolf pups.

75
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:40,070
We have a present.
I hope it's acceptable.

76
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,870
"My First Guillotine." Very educational.
Well played, Frank.

77
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,970
It's great. Thank you.
We just have to baby-proof that.

78
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:54,037
Johnny, do you know
where you put the rubber guards?

79
00:06:54,137 --> 00:06:56,037
Baby-proofing a guillotine?

80
00:06:56,137 --> 00:06:59,537
So you cut your finger off.
It's part of the fun.

81
00:06:59,637 --> 00:07:01,937
She made me baby-proof the whole hotel.

82
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:04,904
Someone's overprotective.

83
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,670
Johnny! Come quick!

84
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,704
What's up? He's okay?

85
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,204
- Dennis said his first word!
- He did?

86
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,204
Come on, honey. Say it again.

87
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:46,870
I don't say, "Bleh, bleh-bleh."

88
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,604
- We didn't say you did.
- Then where did he get that?

89
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,937
Well, maybe sometimes you say it.

90
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:56,437
I only say it when I say I don't say it!

91
00:07:58,137 --> 00:08:01,337
Okay, kid. We get it. You can talk.

92
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,737
Denisovich.

93
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,337
- Dad.
- Just checking for cavities.

94
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:16,504
It was you!

95
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,804
Oh, my goodness, Leonard.

96
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:31,570
If you really looked that hideous,
I don't think I could hang out with you.

97
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,837
Guys, what's the deal?
Is this a party? Pick up a phone.

98
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:38,904
I don't care if Johnny said
it's a "cool app."

99
00:08:39,004 --> 00:08:41,104
Johnny's still new here.

100
00:08:41,204 --> 00:08:44,670
Now, Porridge Head, did you call
a hearse for the Gremlinbergs?

101
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:47,970
No, you're checking
your Facebook page. Again.

102
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,737
Drac, I told the guys social media
is the best way to promote the hotel.

103
00:08:51,837 --> 00:08:53,970
Right, Clifton?

104
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:57,070
So, Drac, I wanted to go
through some thoughts I had,

105
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,137
as your new human relations
coordinating co-assistant.

106
00:09:00,237 --> 00:09:04,504
Sure. It's a real job. Not a cheap excuse to
keep Mavis happy, so you never leave here.

107
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:07,037
Right. So, I was thinking,

108
00:09:07,137 --> 00:09:11,270
since we have so many humans now,
maybe update some of the acts?

109
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,604
- Like, maybe the magician?
- What's wrong with Harry Three-Eye?

110
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,904
Well, he might be a little
old-school for the humans.

111
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:22,004
- Tell me, sir, what was your card?
- The three of spades?

112
00:09:23,637 --> 00:09:27,070
Is this your card, my friend?

113
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:33,704
No, Harry's great. Can't blame Harry
for the crowd not being hip.

114
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:35,670
Okay, what about Wayne?

115
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,404
- Wayne? Are you nuts? He's my boy.
- Then maybe something other than tennis?

116
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:43,470
Okay, so, what you wanna do
is lift the racket right on impact,

117
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,370
so you get that nice top spin.
Try and hit one.

118
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,570
What is that?
What's the noise? It's on me!

119
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,337
It's just the cell phone I got you.

120
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:03,804
Clifton's sending you a text so you
can practice how to write back.

121
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,504
- What the... it's not doing it.
- I got it.

122
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:13,437
Dear Drac...

123
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,570
Now you can text Clifton.

124
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,304
All right, fine.

125
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,904
- How do you do this?
- Maybe it's your fingernails.

126
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:25,237
It's easy. Look. I'll text Mavis.

127
00:10:25,337 --> 00:10:27,870
Psyched for date night.

128
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,537
See? And now look,
she texted right back.

129
00:10:30,637 --> 00:10:34,470
"Gotta cancel.
Can't leave Dennis." Okay.

130
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:39,504
Are we never allowed to be alone again?

131
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:43,570
I need to feel loved, too.

132
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,870
And send.

133
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,304
Okay. All that taught me
is that you're pathetic.

134
00:10:49,404 --> 00:10:51,804
Yeah, got it. Maybe you
should just get Bluetooth.

135
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:54,604
Okay. Blue Tooth, come over here.

136
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,804
So, now what?

137
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,004
- Rise and shine, my Denisovich.
- Hi, Papa.

138
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:11,404
Hello, my little devil.
Did you have sweet nightmares?

139
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,270
I dreamed that I saw a stegosaurus.

140
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:16,870
And were you drinking his blood?

141
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,904
- No.
- Just throwing it out there.

142
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:23,770
- Hey! You want to do something cool?
- Yeah!

143
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,570
I'm going to teach you
how to turn into a bat. Like me.

144
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:30,470
- See?
- Cool.

145
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,970
Yes! Cool, like I said. Now you try.

146
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,337
I'm a bat. I'm a bat. I'm a bat.
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

147
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:44,504
- I mean, a real bat.
- I'm a bat!

148
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:50,104
Denisovich. Take a breath.
You can really turn into a bat.

149
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:53,370
Try. Feel the bat.

150
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:57,270
Not a chicken.

151
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,470
What's that? The electric boogaloo?

152
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,570
If I show you I can bust a move,
will you try to fly, then?

153
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:22,670
Dad? Why are you guys dancing?

154
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,070
- He was sleep-dancing.
- Come on, sweetie. Back to bed.

155
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,870
"Back to bed"?
It's already after 8:00 p.m.

156
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:32,770
Don't you remember the new sleep schedule?
He's going to human classes half the day.

157
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,937
If he could just sleep till 2:00 a.m.
tonight, it'd be so great for him.

158
00:12:37,037 --> 00:12:40,937
But, honeydeath, six of Wayne's wolf pups
are having a birthday party tonight.

159
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:44,637
- You wouldn't want him to miss that.
- Dad, I love the wolf pups,

160
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:47,904
- but they're a little too rough for Dennis.
- "Too rough"?

161
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,970
Haven't you noticed?
Dennis is different.

162
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,204
What are you saying? Denisovich
shouldn't be around monsters?

163
00:12:54,304 --> 00:12:57,304
I love monsters! Video! Video!

164
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,770
Oh, you wanna show Papa Drac
your monster video?

165
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,670
Yeah!

166
00:13:03,337 --> 00:13:05,837
<i>Who's the coolest monster?</i>

167
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:07,470
Kakie!

168
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,604
<i>Wee! Kakie one happy monster!</i>

169
00:13:10,704 --> 00:13:13,304
<i>Kakie love cake! Yummy!</i>

170
00:13:13,404 --> 00:13:15,604
<i>Tummy get a tummyache.</i>

171
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:18,970
How is that a monster?

172
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,137
<i>Have some cake, Wuzzlelumplebum.</i>

173
00:13:21,237 --> 00:13:25,037
<i>Remember, kids,
a real monster always shares.</i>

174
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:29,870
"Shares"? Yes! When I think monsters,
I think "shares."

175
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,304
Now, let me tell you
what a real monster is, Denisovich.

176
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:38,337
Dad, please. He's practically
five already. Don't force it.

177
00:13:41,204 --> 00:13:44,170
<i>Slow down, Wuzzlelumplebum.</i>

178
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:52,070
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder...</i>

179
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,770
Mommy, I'm too old for lullabies.

180
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,837
What? That's not how that one goes.

181
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:01,337
- This is the way most people sing it.
- "Most people"? What's wrong with...

182
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:04,537
<i>Suffer, suffer, scream in pain</i>

183
00:14:04,637 --> 00:14:07,670
<i>Blood is spilling from your brain</i>

184
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,804
- Daddy.
- Come on. You know how I sang it to you.

185
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:14,204
<i>Zombies gnaw you like a plum</i>

186
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:18,504
<i>Piercing cries and you succumb</i>

187
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:22,804
<i>Suffer, suffer, scream in pain</i>

188
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:29,104
<i>You will never breathe again</i>

189
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,537
Still works.

190
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:59,537
Happy birthday, Wally, Wilson,
Whoopi, Waylon, Weepy and Wanye.

191
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,470
Denisovich! My big boy! You made it!

192
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:08,737
I thought about what you said, Dad.
Maybe I was being a little overprotective.

193
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:11,070
Thank you, coffin cake.

194
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:14,037
- Dennis! I love you! Zing!
- Hi, Winnie.

195
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:18,437
I just love your yummy
strawberry locks! Zing, zing!

196
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:24,470
Winnie. Give him his space, hon.
I'm sorry, Mavis.

197
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,104
It's okay, Aunt Wanda.
They're just playing.

198
00:15:27,204 --> 00:15:31,004
Holy rabies! Limbo?
I used to love that game!

199
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:34,570
- Get in there, Mavey.
- Really? But I'm a parent now.

200
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,770
- Show 'em how it's done.
- Okay. Okay, okay.

201
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:49,170
No way! A pinata?

202
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:53,670
Oh, Mavis, honey. That's for later.

203
00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:57,637
We don't want the pups
to have too much...

204
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,137
Candy!

205
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,770
...sugar.

206
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,337
I'm sorry. Did I start all that?

207
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:15,670
Don't worry. There's a reason
they call it a litter.

208
00:16:27,604 --> 00:16:29,837
Dennis! Are you okay?

209
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:33,370
- I got a candy.
- Look! Your tooth came out.

210
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,104
Are you kidding me?
He got his tooth knocked out?

211
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:38,904
Oh, yes, indeed. Here comes the fang.

212
00:16:39,004 --> 00:16:42,370
Dad. His baby tooth wasn't a fang.
Why would this one be?

213
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,804
He's not a monster.

214
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,570
The sun's gonna come out soon,
and we gotta get to his classes.

215
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:55,770
What's wrong with the classes
we have here? Like the kids' yoga?

216
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,404
Yoga!

217
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,104
This is Denisovich's home.

218
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,937
- I don't know, Dad.
- What don't you know?

219
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:08,470
Well, we've been talking about moving.

220
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,004
Somewhere safer for Dennis.

221
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,870
Maybe where Johnny
grew up in California.

222
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,370
I'm sorry, but you can't just make
somebody something they're not.

223
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,237
- Come on, honey. We have to go.
- Zing, zing?

224
00:17:23,937 --> 00:17:27,970
Mavey, wait. You can't mean that.

225
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:32,170
You're in on this? The leaving?

226
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:36,237
It's not definite at all. It's just something
she's definitely talking about,

227
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:39,037
but until we do it,
it's not definitized.

228
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:44,304
Did he just cover me with birdseed?

229
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:47,104
Yeah, he covered me.

230
00:17:56,637 --> 00:17:59,104
Dad, it's not a fang.

231
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:04,004
Dad, I don't know if it's the right place
for Dennis. Right, Johnny?

232
00:18:04,104 --> 00:18:07,604
Oh, hey, dudeman.
It's not me. It's Mavey.

233
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:10,637
Hey, dudeman.
I'm afraid to say anything.

234
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:13,670
Hey, dudeman. I'm a dudeman!

235
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,637
Drac? Who you talkin' to?

236
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:18,437
Do not disturb.
The count's wiggin' out in here.

237
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,304
What are you wiggin' out about, Drac?

238
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,370
The kids. Mavey Wavey's saying
she wants to leave.

239
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,370
She wants to leave? What about Johnny?
He doesn't wanna go.

240
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,770
He's making the hotel
more human-y for Dennis.

241
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,804
You know, seeing
that he isn't a monster.

242
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:34,837
He is a monster!
He's just a late fanger.

243
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,704
- And I could be a hand model.
- Shut up!

244
00:18:37,804 --> 00:18:42,570
It's all that human-y stuff
that's confusing poor Denisovich.

245
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,270
So maybe you gotta get the kid
around more monster-y things.

246
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,870
Oh, I need a cape.

247
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,370
I can't. She's always around,
checking up on me.

248
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,670
Man, if you... if you could
just get some alone time.

249
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,237
Wait a minute.
That's what Johnny wants, too.

250
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,241
Alone time with Mavis.

251
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:07,037
Have they even had a vacation
since before they were married?

252
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:14,037
They're going to now. And so are we.
Frank, you're a genius.

253
00:19:30,037 --> 00:19:33,170
We'll take Denisovich
to all our old haunts.

254
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,237
<i>Each of us will show him our skills.</i>

255
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,870
<i>Teach him how to be a monster.</i>

256
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:45,137
And he'll be fanging it up in no time.

257
00:19:45,237 --> 00:19:46,937
Boy turns five next week.

258
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:49,870
If he's not a vampire by his birthday,
it ain't happenin'.

259
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,137
Oh, it ain't ain't happening, baby.

260
00:19:52,237 --> 00:19:56,070
- All he needs is time with his vampa.
- "Vampa"?

261
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,104
Vampire grandpa.
Come on, man. That's obvious.

262
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:04,704
Johnny. Come outside.

263
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:06,370
What? Who is it?

264
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:09,404
It's your father-in-law.
I need to talk to you.

265
00:20:10,737 --> 00:20:12,737
What's up?

266
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,737
Let me get rid of them. Sorry.

267
00:20:15,837 --> 00:20:19,270
No problem-o.
I was kinda diggin' the attention.

268
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,037
Can they stay? I don't think
they're ready to leave yet.

269
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:28,004
Come on. Go to your mother.
Look, you want to stay here, right?

270
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:31,604
Of course. This is the first place
where I can really be myself.

271
00:20:31,704 --> 00:20:35,304
I haven't felt this alive since
they invented stuffed-crust pizza.

272
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:39,870
Well, then, we've got some work to do.
Okay, so here's the plan.

273
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,570
Maybe it's a good idea to take her
to your hometown. But remember...

274
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,604
So, it's sliced avocado,
rolled oats with apricot,

275
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,770
the Aveeno moisturizer after every bath.

276
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,237
And then the Shea butter
on his tush before his PJs

277
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,604
and then 20 minutes with the nebulizer

278
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:59,170
while I read his Learning Factory
Phonics book to him.

279
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,437
It's asking a lot, Dad.
We could just take Dennis with us.

280
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:05,770
What? Are you kidding me?
And get him off his routine?

281
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,204
No, no, no. You kids go to California,
and see if it's the right place

282
00:21:10,304 --> 00:21:13,104
- to raise Denisovich.
- And you remember how to video chat?

283
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:16,470
Yes, yes. With the phone
and the buttons and the agony.

284
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,404
Thanks for being so understanding, Dad.
I know you'll keep him safe.

285
00:21:20,504 --> 00:21:24,204
Of course, Mavey.
Stake my heart and hope to die.

286
00:21:24,304 --> 00:21:27,170
I'm just gonna miss him so much.

287
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,904
- I love you, Dennis.
- I love you, Mommy.

288
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:34,337
I'll tell him Mavey Wavey stories
every night before bed.

289
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:37,070
You're the best. I love you, Dad.

290
00:21:39,837 --> 00:21:42,870
Gonna miss all you guys.
You're all my family.

291
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,470
- Love you, Drac.
- Yes. I love you, too.

292
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,137
Now, remember the plan.
Just keep her distracted and happy.

293
00:21:51,237 --> 00:21:53,837
- But not too happy, capisce?
- Got it.

294
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,337
Operation "Just Keep Her
Distracted and Happy,

295
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:59,804
"But Not Too Happy, Capisce,"
starts now. Cool?

296
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,704
- Smiling on the outside.
- Will you hug my backpack?

297
00:22:02,804 --> 00:22:03,804
No.

298
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,304
Back to bed.

299
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:15,170
Yes, we'll get to the bed.
We all love the bed.

300
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:18,904
But we're just gonna do one thing first.

301
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,037
Is it shorts weather where we're going?

302
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:26,070
Jeez. I hope not.
My body isn't swimsuit-ready yet.

303
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,204
Whatever. Where's Griffin?

304
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:30,737
Hey, can I have a second?
I'm just saying goodbye to Emily.

305
00:22:30,837 --> 00:22:32,237
Oh, brother.

306
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,770
I'm gonna miss you so much.

307
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,037
You know, you have to be strong, honey.
Because what we have is unbreakable.

308
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:43,304
Babe, don't cry. Everyone's looking.

309
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:45,004
Okay, I gotta call him on this.

310
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:47,537
Just let him play it out,
get it over with.

311
00:22:47,637 --> 00:22:52,437
Okay, you two lovebirds. Drink
your champagne and let's get going.

312
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,870
Oh, yeah. No, sure. Okay. Cheers, babe.

313
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:00,270
Oh. You klutz.

314
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,370
- We can't say nothin' about this?
- No. We don't have time for zingers.

315
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:15,970
How do you click in the stupid car seat?

316
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,404
You gotta cut those nails, man.

317
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,837
We just strap our kids down
with duct tape.

318
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,537
What's he doing here?

319
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,904
I told him he could come.
He's never been outside the hotel.

320
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:32,204
Blobby, there's no room. Sorry, man.

321
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,737
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

322
00:23:35,837 --> 00:23:39,037
Fine, put him on the Rascal.
Let's just get going.

323
00:23:53,504 --> 00:23:55,770
Where are we going, Papa Drac?

324
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,470
Oh, Denisovich, we're going to have
an adventure. A monster-y adventure.

325
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,704
Yay! Monsters! We're gonna eat cake.

326
00:24:03,804 --> 00:24:07,704
- What did he say?
- No. No cake on this monster trip.

327
00:24:07,804 --> 00:24:12,137
No cake, cebause Kakie says,
"Too much cake makes tummy ache."

328
00:24:12,237 --> 00:24:16,204
Yay! "A monster always shares."

329
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,170
We may need more than a week.

330
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,337
Hey, you know who could fix
the kid in a snap? Vlad.

331
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:26,570
What? We don't need to call Vlad.
We got this.

332
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,470
You see, Denisovich,
monsters are nice, just like you.

333
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:36,504
But when the moon comes out,
the real monster fun begins.

334
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:40,704
Being scary. Right, guys?

335
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:46,170
Guys? Guys! What is wrong with you?

336
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,370
Come on. Everybody likes that song.

337
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,337
We're not everybody.
We're scary monsters. Remember?

338
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:55,270
- Hey, what are you putting in?
- It's an audio book.

339
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,737
Bigfoot's life story.
He reads it himself.

340
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:00,870
<i>Chapter One.</i>

341
00:25:34,004 --> 00:25:35,704
This is gonna be so amazing.

342
00:25:35,804 --> 00:25:40,404
Oh, yeah. You're gonna be so happy,
but not too happy. What?

343
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:42,637
I wanna see everything
you did growing up.

344
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:45,570
As long as you're distracted, capisce?

345
00:25:46,704 --> 00:25:48,637
We can hit a few spots
on the way to my parents.

346
00:25:48,737 --> 00:25:51,737
- Lemme just quickly call home.
- Don't do that.

347
00:25:51,837 --> 00:25:54,704
It's only 1:00 a.m. there.
Dennis isn't even up yet.

348
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:57,637
Right. I'm just not used
to being away from him.

349
00:25:57,737 --> 00:26:00,737
Everything's gonna be cool.
Your dad was so all over it.

350
00:26:00,837 --> 00:26:03,070
I know. He's the best.

351
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,537
Right turn, here.

352
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,937
Denisovich, rise and shine.

353
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:31,570
Boys, this bringing back any memories?

354
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:34,937
We used to prowl around here
when we were in our 100s.

355
00:26:35,037 --> 00:26:38,804
The Dark Forest of Slobozia.

356
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,304
- Nice how they built it up.
- Okay, out of the car.

357
00:26:51,804 --> 00:26:56,670
Denisovich... you're going to see
every monster do his specialty.

358
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,670
First, Frank's gonna show us
how he scares people.

359
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:03,304
Yay! He's gonna say, "Boo."

360
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:05,837
Yeah, I don't think "boos" ever work.

361
00:27:05,937 --> 00:27:09,937
But that's why we're here.
To learn from the master.

362
00:27:10,404 --> 00:27:12,670
Okay, I'll give it a shot.

363
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:30,204
Yeah, guess it just depends on work.

364
00:27:31,904 --> 00:27:35,037
- Frankenstein!
- Hey, how ya doin'?

365
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:38,404
You're awesome!
Can we take a picture? Is that okay?

366
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:41,437
Sure, okay. Little selfie action.

367
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,270
For real?

368
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:46,904
- Awesome! Thank you so much.
- Hey, have a great day.

369
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:51,004
- Boo!
- He's adorable.

370
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:56,670
Adorable, yes.
Not scary, but "boo" is a start.

371
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,704
My birthday cake's gonna have
the coolest guy on it.

372
00:28:09,804 --> 00:28:11,904
Let me guess. Kakie.

373
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:15,804
No. He's so cool.
He climbs walls and wears a cape.

374
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,037
Oh, really.
And who is this very cool guy?

375
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:22,370
- Batman!
- Batman. Great.

376
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:27,270
You don't know anyone else with a cape
that's cool? This is good. Stop here.

377
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:36,137
Okay, Wayne. It's your turn.
Go kill something.

378
00:28:36,237 --> 00:28:38,637
- Denisovich, watch this.
- What?

379
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,004
I told you, come on.

380
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:44,237
If we don't inspire Denisovich,
how's he going to find his inner monster?

381
00:28:44,337 --> 00:28:47,004
- Who's in a monster?
- Nobody, just...

382
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:49,404
- Here, have an avocado.
- Yay!

383
00:28:49,504 --> 00:28:53,537
Your mommy says it's a good fat.
Whatever the heaven that means.

384
00:28:53,637 --> 00:28:58,004
Listen, I'm not gonna set monsters back again
just to make your grandkid like vampires.

385
00:28:58,104 --> 00:29:01,104
Anyway, there's nothing to kill here.
It's all been...

386
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:08,337
What a cutie. But kill him.

387
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:12,004
Oh, great. You know
I haven't done this in years.

388
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:14,970
We don't need to kill anymore.
We have Pop-Tarts.

389
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,104
Denisovich, you're going to love this.

390
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:22,037
Wayne's going to eat that whole deer,
and the next one's yours. Wayne, go.

391
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:31,370
Oh, man. I'm too old for this.
Okay, how's it go again?

392
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:36,604
No, no, wait. That's for the moon.
Oh, I growl. Right, here goes.

393
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:41,470
- Growl!
- Get it, boy.

394
00:29:46,504 --> 00:29:48,204
Get it, Uncle Wayne.

395
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,237
Some werewolf.
Did you actually say the word "growl?"

396
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:57,470
- You're a werewussy.
- I said I was rusty.

397
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,570
- Gimme me that Frisbee.
- No! It's my Frisbee! I fetched it!

398
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,237
Give it to me! Give it back!

399
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:06,637
Give it over here!
Give me that! Give it back!

400
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,804
He's fine. He's Blobby.

401
00:30:16,037 --> 00:30:18,904
This place is so amazing and scenic.

402
00:30:19,004 --> 00:30:20,937
What do you wanna show me first?

403
00:30:21,037 --> 00:30:24,770
I don't know. It's pretty, but there's really
nothing to do once it gets dark.

404
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:26,637
Wait. What's that place?

405
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:34,870
So, you're telling me that I can pick
between all these different kinds of chips?

406
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,304
- Yes.
- How do people decide?

407
00:30:40,204 --> 00:30:43,537
Now what's that
beautiful fountain of rubies?

408
00:30:44,304 --> 00:30:48,304
- Johnny, have you tried this Slurpee?
- Not that quickly, hon.

409
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:52,704
It comes in 48 flavors.
We have to try them all.

410
00:30:55,204 --> 00:30:56,604
I don't know if we have time.

411
00:30:56,704 --> 00:30:59,770
Why? This place is open
all night. Right, sir?

412
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,037
Yes.

413
00:31:05,604 --> 00:31:06,404
Johnny, look.

414
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:09,904
<i>They're making a TV show
about this place and we're the stars.</i>

415
00:31:10,004 --> 00:31:12,637
- <i>Hello, world.</i>
- <i>Awesome.</i>

416
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:16,670
<i>It's totally awesome.
You're so lucky, Kal.</i>

417
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:19,470
<i>Hello, world.</i>

418
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,304
Okay, Murray. Your turn.

419
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:28,970
Excuse us. Do you know where
someone can get a bite around here?

420
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,937
Did you seriously just ask
a vampire where to get a bite?

421
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,704
Oh, gosh. I didn't mean...
We're not from around here.

422
00:31:34,804 --> 00:31:37,404
This is so embarrassing.
Just keep going.

423
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:39,970
Sorry to bother you.
Love your chocolate cereal.

424
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,604
- So, what do you want me to do now?
- Denisovich, you won't believe it.

425
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:51,137
The mummy can crash through walls
and turn into a swarm of beetles

426
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,370
and put a curse on anyone.

427
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,137
- That sounds mean.
- It's fun mean.

428
00:31:56,237 --> 00:31:57,737
Okay. So, check it out.

429
00:31:57,837 --> 00:32:02,937
Murray's going to conjure up
the biggest sandstorm you've ever seen.

430
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:06,070
- Hit it!
- Sandstorm? It's been awhile.

431
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,770
Not my problem. Do it.
Say your little spell.

432
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,370
Okay.

433
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:16,304
I got this. Frank, Wayne,
Griffin, just try not to faint.

434
00:32:37,204 --> 00:32:38,937
My back.

435
00:32:47,737 --> 00:32:49,904
Oh. Wait.

436
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:57,170
How cute!

437
00:33:03,337 --> 00:33:07,137
Wait. Stop at that playground.
Look at these cute kids.

438
00:33:13,404 --> 00:33:16,604
Holy rabies! This looks like a blast.

439
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:20,737
I don't know, Mavey. This can be pretty
dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.

440
00:33:20,837 --> 00:33:24,370
Of course, I rock these bikes.
May I, little dude?

441
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,370
Check it out. Oh, yeah.

442
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,270
This is how I rolled every summer.

443
00:33:44,104 --> 00:33:45,470
I think I scratched it.

444
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:47,704
My turn.

445
00:33:47,804 --> 00:33:51,337
Mavey, I told you,
it took me years to get this good.

446
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:54,437
Well, I'll give it a try.

447
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,137
You feel me now?
That's my girlfriend, suckers.

448
00:34:35,237 --> 00:34:37,970
- Your wife, Johnny.
- My wife. Even better.

449
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,970
That was sick, lady.
Where did you learn how to do that stuff?

450
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,104
Transylvania.

451
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:46,537
That's cool.
I have a cousin from Pennsylvania.

452
00:34:46,637 --> 00:34:50,204
Oh. These little guys are so sweet.
Dennis would love them.

453
00:34:50,304 --> 00:34:54,104
- What an awesome place to raise a kid.
- To raise a kid?

454
00:34:54,204 --> 00:34:59,104
I don't know about awesome.
Maybe tubular. Capisce?

455
00:34:59,204 --> 00:35:02,137
Anyways, we should hit my folks' place.
I said we'd be there by now.

456
00:35:02,237 --> 00:35:07,804
Sure. Hey, it's after 3:00 in Transylvania.
I'm gonna check on Dennis, okay?

457
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:15,037
Chocolate cereal. Are you kidding me?

458
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:17,337
It's okay, Drac.
It's 'cause they love us.

459
00:35:17,437 --> 00:35:19,837
Yeah. Monsters are what's goin' on.

460
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:23,937
Yeah. You should embrace it like I did.
I've got a best-selling workout video.

461
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:26,637
Follow me, ladies. Right. And left.

462
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:29,504
No, girls. Watch me.
You're not watching.

463
00:35:29,604 --> 00:35:32,704
Here we go. And eight
and seven and six...

464
00:35:32,804 --> 00:35:33,970
That's not me, guys.

465
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,437
Come on, even Bigfoot's tearin' it up
in the German soccer league.

466
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,370
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. It's Mavis.

467
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,470
You gotta answer it.

468
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:55,170
- You're pushin' too hard. Lighter.
- All right!

469
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,437
Denisovich, wake up.
Oh, boy, he's out cold.

470
00:35:58,537 --> 00:36:00,570
I got this.

471
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,804
- Dad, what took so long?
- <i>What?</i>

472
00:36:04,904 --> 00:36:10,337
Nothing, Mavey. We're all great here
at the hotel. Just doing hotel things.

473
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:13,299
- Sorry, can't handle your breath.
- I hear ya.

474
00:36:13,399 --> 00:36:14,737
How are you?

475
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:20,304
<i>We're having a blast. We just went biking
and mini-marting. It's so fun here.</i>

476
00:36:20,404 --> 00:36:23,070
- <i>Is Dennis okay?</i>
- Oh. Of course.

477
00:36:23,604 --> 00:36:26,670
- <i>You want to see him?</i>
- Yes. Yes, I do.

478
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:29,470
- Hi, baby. How are you?
- <i>Mommy.</i>

479
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,970
I happy.

480
00:36:32,537 --> 00:36:35,637
- <i>Hey, little dude.</i>
- Why is he wearing sunglasses?

481
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:40,604
<i>Oh, we were playing.
It's a superhero thing.</i>

482
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:43,937
Cebause, I'm Sunglasses Man,
to the rescue!

483
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,937
- Okay, take it down a notch.
- I'm flying.

484
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,270
You sound funny.

485
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,237
Oh, no, no, that's his
Sunglasses Man voice.

486
00:36:51,337 --> 00:36:53,737
Static. The signal is bad.

487
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:57,237
- Mavis, are you there?
- Yeah, I'm still...

488
00:36:57,904 --> 00:37:00,704
All right. I guess he's having fun.

489
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:03,170
Of course he is.

490
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:06,904
I nailed it with the Sunglasses Man.

491
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:10,370
Right off the top of my head. I threw in
a "cebause." Did everyone see that?

492
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:13,204
She said she was having fun.
Johnny's blowing it.

493
00:37:13,304 --> 00:37:16,470
She's biking and mini-marting.
She's gonna wanna move!

494
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,770
I gotta fix this kid now.
Are we almost there or what?

495
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,437
Okay, I may have taken
a wrong turn a few miles back.

496
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:26,170
- Don't get mad.
- What?

497
00:37:27,137 --> 00:37:29,370
Someone turn on the navigator
on this thing.

498
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,104
Look how light I touch it.

499
00:37:31,204 --> 00:37:34,437
<i>Please enter your destination.</i>

500
00:37:34,537 --> 00:37:38,604
<i>Please. I am begging you.</i>

501
00:37:40,904 --> 00:37:43,170
Yeah, this is gonna be good, Denisovich.

502
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,104
Scary stuff, okay? It's in you.

503
00:37:46,204 --> 00:37:48,937
We just gotta concentrate on the scary.

504
00:37:49,037 --> 00:37:51,770
Papa Drac? Do you miss Grandma?

505
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,804
Miss Grandma? Oh. Sure, I do.

506
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:59,804
I miss her every day. She was my zing.

507
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:03,070
- Why do you ask?
- I don't know.

508
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,070
- Do you miss anybody?
- I miss Mommy and Daddy.

509
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,837
And who else? You miss that Winnie?

510
00:38:09,937 --> 00:38:13,204
The pup who tackles you and tries
to lick you all the time?

511
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:15,337
Yeah, but we're just friends.

512
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:18,104
Oh, no, no, no. You're a Dracula.

513
00:38:18,204 --> 00:38:21,970
You can't just be friends with a cute,
hairy number like Winnie.

514
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:27,737
Right turn, now! Here. You imbecile!

515
00:38:27,837 --> 00:38:30,570
- Oh, right. Turn, Griffin!
- Yes, Papa Drac.

516
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:39,570
Wait and see, fellas. This kid'll
be guzzling goat blood in no time.

517
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:44,070
<i>You have arrived
at your destination. Yes! Yes!</i>

518
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,004
Here we are. It's the vampire
summer camp I went to as a kid.

519
00:38:48,104 --> 00:38:52,537
- What's it, Camp Vamp?
- No. Who names their camp "Camp Vamp?"

520
00:38:52,637 --> 00:38:55,770
It's Camp Winnepacaca.

521
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:20,970
You see, Denisovich? This is where
I learned to catch mice and shapeshift.

522
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,937
And use my incredible powers
and strength. It's pretty cool.

523
00:39:25,037 --> 00:39:26,270
Badminton.

524
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,637
Yes, I don't remember this badminting.

525
00:39:33,737 --> 00:39:36,870
Well, well, is this a night?
How ya doin', folks?

526
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,537
I'm Dana, the director.

527
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:43,004
We're sure excited to have you legends
visitin' us. What can I do you for?

528
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:48,870
Well, I'm very interested in sending
my grandboy, Denisovich, here.

529
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,337
This little redheaded,
non-fangy little guy?

530
00:39:52,437 --> 00:39:56,004
Oh, they're in there. He's a late fanger.
That's why we came here.

531
00:39:56,104 --> 00:40:00,237
Can you show us some of the drills,
like where they catch the mice?

532
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:04,370
Can do. A-course now
we call it Tee-Mousing.

533
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,970
So they don't have to catch the mice?

534
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,404
Nope. We find this is a good way
to build their confidence.

535
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:24,270
Come here.

536
00:40:24,604 --> 00:40:26,870
It's right there!
What's the matter with you?

537
00:40:28,537 --> 00:40:30,070
Hokey-pokey.

538
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,904
There it is, Denisovich.
Where Papa learned to fly.

539
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:38,137
I wanna fly like Papa.

540
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:47,837
Yeah. We're over here, now.

541
00:40:47,937 --> 00:40:51,404
Had to scale it down. Insurance.

542
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,104
Help me. Help me. Help me.

543
00:40:56,604 --> 00:41:00,270
Hokey-pokey. See ya at the campfire.

544
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:07,337
Well, gosh! Welcome, you two.

545
00:41:07,437 --> 00:41:11,704
- Hey, gang.
- Hi, guys. This is so exciting.

546
00:41:11,804 --> 00:41:16,170
Look at all of this. So cool.

547
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,204
I can't believe I'm actually here.

548
00:41:18,304 --> 00:41:22,937
Well, you are. Now, how does it work?
Are you up all night and sleep all day?

549
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:26,004
- Yeah.
- I'll do whatever you guys want.

550
00:41:26,104 --> 00:41:29,304
Good. 'Cause I bought
this pretty sunhat for you.

551
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,504
But otherwise this poncho,
if you wanna be safe.

552
00:41:31,604 --> 00:41:34,937
- We can deal with it later, Linda.
- Okay.

553
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,070
Come see.

554
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,570
I've set up your bedroom.

555
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,404
It's just like Transylvania.

556
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:49,504
Oh, Transylvania.
That was a fun experience.

557
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:51,637
Mike was afraid he'd get
disemboweled and eaten,

558
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:55,370
- but I told him he was just being silly.
- That was you, Linda.

559
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:00,437
There they are. You know, we have a couple
of mixed families in the neighborhood,

560
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:02,404
so I thought I'd invite them over.

561
00:42:02,504 --> 00:42:06,737
They might be nice for you guys to talk to
since you're thinkin' about moving here.

562
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,204
Hi, Caren. Hi, Pandragora.

563
00:42:10,304 --> 00:42:13,137
- Welcome, Mavis.
- Hey, guys.

564
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,404
Yeah, you're gonna dig it here.
Don't even worry.

565
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:19,770
People are totally cool
with our lifestyle choice.

566
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,104
I mean, the kids get picked on a little,
but it toughens them up.

567
00:42:23,504 --> 00:42:26,670
Oh, hey, you guys. And this is
Loretta. She's married to Paul,

568
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,837
- who's a werewolf.
- Excuse me?

569
00:42:28,937 --> 00:42:32,670
Yes, I was telling Mavis about the other
monster-human couples in town.

570
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:36,904
- I am not a werewolf.
- Oh. I thought...

571
00:42:37,004 --> 00:42:40,870
Well, you're welcome to stay
and have some cupcakes.

572
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:47,504
<i>Vampires will be friends forever</i>

573
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:51,804
<i>Through the centuries together</i>

574
00:42:51,904 --> 00:42:56,070
<i>Even in the brightest sunny weather</i>

575
00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,570
<i>Vampires will be friends forever</i>

576
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,870
<i>Literally</i>

577
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,537
<i>Forever</i>

578
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:14,970
Great job, vampires.
Give yourselves a hug.

579
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,504
- We're going.
- What? Where?

580
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:29,837
Why are we doing this?

581
00:43:29,937 --> 00:43:32,537
You'd rather be listening
to those putrid new songs?

582
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:35,137
<i>What happened to Michael Row
Your Corpse Ashore?</i>

583
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:37,904
<i>Or Old McWerewolf Had An Axe?</i>

584
00:43:42,904 --> 00:43:44,970
We shouldn't be up here, Drac.

585
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:49,070
- Who's ready to fly?
- Me! Me! Like a superhero.

586
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,404
Better! Like a vampire!

587
00:43:52,204 --> 00:43:55,937
This thing is rickety. You know what?
Maybe the kid isn't supposed to fly.

588
00:43:56,037 --> 00:44:00,570
Quiet. This is how they learn.
You throw them and they figure it out.

589
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,237
- It's how I was taught.
- I wanna fly now!

590
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:07,137
Attabat. You know Papa's
right here if you need him.

591
00:44:07,937 --> 00:44:09,904
- I can't watch this.
- Please don't.

592
00:44:10,004 --> 00:44:12,537
Here we go!

593
00:44:19,004 --> 00:44:21,970
- He's still not flying.
- He will.

594
00:44:22,904 --> 00:44:25,870
- Still not.
- It'll happen.

595
00:44:26,304 --> 00:44:29,270
- This is a tall tower.
- That's why it's good.

596
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,737
- You should get him.
- He's gonna fall to his death.

597
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:34,404
He's taking his time.

598
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,504
- Drac!
- I did that my first time.

599
00:44:38,604 --> 00:44:41,404
He's getting too close to the ground!

600
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:43,404
You know what? He's not gonna fly.

601
00:44:53,537 --> 00:44:56,904
I told you. Papa's always here for you.

602
00:44:57,004 --> 00:44:58,670
Again! Again!

603
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:01,804
Oh, dear. Oh, my devil.
We're gonna have to report this.

604
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:04,804
You mean to the papers?
I guess it was pretty cool,

605
00:45:04,904 --> 00:45:09,004
- but I'm not about getting press.
- No, sir. I mean the authorities.

606
00:45:09,104 --> 00:45:12,137
I can't not report child endangerment.

607
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:14,537
Listen to me. That was fun.

608
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:17,137
Your singing is child endangerment.

609
00:45:17,237 --> 00:45:18,737
Should we go down and help him?

610
00:45:18,837 --> 00:45:21,804
Nope. I told him this was nuts.
He's on his own.

611
00:45:21,904 --> 00:45:25,104
- We have to call the boy's mother.
- No, that ain't happening.

612
00:45:25,204 --> 00:45:27,837
His mother's already nutsy koo koo!

613
00:45:27,937 --> 00:45:30,137
I have to follow protocol.

614
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:33,770
You will not follow protocol.

615
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:37,104
I'm a vampire. I can't be hypnotized.

616
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:38,737
- Right.
- Now, please.

617
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:43,470
- Don't make me call the police.
- No one's calling nobody!

618
00:45:45,504 --> 00:45:47,037
Fire!

619
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:50,004
Stop, drop and roll.
Stop, drop and roll.

620
00:45:50,104 --> 00:45:52,437
Screaming's not helping!

621
00:46:00,104 --> 00:46:02,570
Are we bad guys, Papa Drac?

622
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,737
Bad?

623
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:08,004
No. You're the best kid in the world.

624
00:46:08,104 --> 00:46:11,237
We didn't start the fire.
It was the tower.

625
00:46:11,337 --> 00:46:16,037
That's a very unsafe tower.
You're lucky we don't call the authorities.

626
00:46:16,137 --> 00:46:20,904
- Let's go, my hero.
- Cebause I'm Batman! To the Batmobile!

627
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,570
Yes. To the...

628
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,304
Sorry about all that stuff.
I guess they thought you'd like it.

629
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:38,470
Why do I feel so weird here?

630
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,670
No, hon. They're being weird.

631
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,837
I think they're just trying to help me.

632
00:46:42,937 --> 00:46:46,670
I mean, I grew up knowing nothing
living inside that hotel.

633
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,904
And you learned about everything
growing up in Santa Claus.

634
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:52,037
Santa Cruz. But...

635
00:46:52,137 --> 00:46:55,037
Maybe if Dennis grows up
away from Transylvania,

636
00:46:55,137 --> 00:46:59,270
he won't be so freaky. Like me.

637
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:02,604
Are you nuts? Mavis, you're a blast.

638
00:47:02,704 --> 00:47:05,604
You're so full of life
and curious about everything.

639
00:47:05,704 --> 00:47:10,504
If Dennis grows up to be just like you,
I'll be the luckiest dad in the world.

640
00:47:11,104 --> 00:47:13,337
I love you, Johnnystein.

641
00:47:13,437 --> 00:47:17,704
You know what? As long as we're all
together, we'll be happy anywhere.

642
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:20,304
Even at the hotel.

643
00:47:20,437 --> 00:47:22,504
Yes!

644
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:26,137
What are you doing?

645
00:47:26,237 --> 00:47:30,637
Check out this video my friend sent me.
This kid is an awesome daredevil.

646
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:35,670
- <i>Oh, dude! Did you get it?</i>
- Wait! Is that Dennis?

647
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,604
No! Is it? No.
It's just hard to see. But...

648
00:47:40,704 --> 00:47:43,637
Oops. Just deleted it. So, it's gone.

649
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:57,037
What? It's Mavis. I'm not answering it.

650
00:47:58,004 --> 00:48:00,704
Come on, Drac. You have to.

651
00:48:02,704 --> 00:48:04,204
All right!

652
00:48:04,304 --> 00:48:05,904
Yes, honeybunch.

653
00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:08,070
<i>Dad? Where are you?</i>

654
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:11,370
We're outside the hotel
having a little cookout.

655
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:14,504
- It's perfectly safe.
- What's that noise? Is that a siren?

656
00:48:14,604 --> 00:48:18,137
Oh, those are just some wailing
banshees checking in.

657
00:48:18,237 --> 00:48:22,604
Quiet, you banshees. We're trying to have
a perfectly safe cookout over here.

658
00:48:22,704 --> 00:48:25,770
Mommy! I wanna say hi! Mommy! Mommy!

659
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,370
- Papa Drac just tried to teach me how to fly.
- Wait a minute. Is that the mother?

660
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,737
- <i>Oh, no. Static again.</i>
- I am coming back to the hotel right now.

661
00:48:33,837 --> 00:48:39,270
And you better be there or I swear, Dad,
you're gonna be very sorry.

662
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,704
- What's goin' on?
- We need to get home right away.

663
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:47,370
Okay. I'll go wake up my backpack.

664
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,370
Guys, we gotta move. We got no car!
How we gonna get out of here?

665
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,304
Don't worry. I made a call.

666
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:06,070
I'm sorry, Blobby.
We really meant to call you sooner.

667
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,370
Hit it!

668
00:49:28,537 --> 00:49:29,604
Transylvania.

669
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:32,637
- You want to go where?
- Transylvania. As soon as possible.

670
00:49:32,737 --> 00:49:35,837
- We don't fly direct to Transylvania.
- You don't?

671
00:49:35,937 --> 00:49:39,904
You can go to Bucharest, but you'll have
to switch planes in Chicago and then Zurich.

672
00:49:40,004 --> 00:49:41,537
So, when would we get there?

673
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:44,970
Well, the Chicago flight's delayed
due to bad weather.

674
00:49:50,504 --> 00:49:54,170
- So, two seats in coach?
- No!

675
00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:56,004
- No!
- Yes.

676
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:18,570
You have to go now?
When we finally have no traffic.

677
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,237
You're killing me, Blobby.

678
00:50:30,204 --> 00:50:33,270
I still have some cloud on me.
Gotta do a selfie!

679
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,104
- Johnny! Not now!
- Okay. Maybe later.

680
00:50:41,904 --> 00:50:45,137
This scooter thing's out of juice.
We're never gonna make it.

681
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:47,004
Frank, blow.

682
00:50:56,204 --> 00:50:58,170
Now!

683
00:51:19,604 --> 00:51:24,470
How fun is this? Why are you laughing?
You like that? Watch this.

684
00:51:36,237 --> 00:51:40,804
- Now this is flying, Denisovich.
- Like a vampire.

685
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,970
That's my boy. Look at you go.

686
00:51:55,737 --> 00:52:00,004
You're the coolest guy
who wears a cape, Papa Drac.

687
00:52:27,704 --> 00:52:33,037
So, hey, when are you going to get here
already? We've been waiting...

688
00:52:34,304 --> 00:52:36,504
Give me my son.

689
00:52:36,604 --> 00:52:38,937
We just went out for some avocados.

690
00:52:39,037 --> 00:52:41,970
- Mommy! I flew!
- I saw.

691
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:46,604
<i>Mother's already nutsy koo koo
Nutsy koo koo</i>

692
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:50,204
<i>Oh, dear, oh, dear
Oh, my devil I have to follow protocol</i>

693
00:52:50,304 --> 00:52:52,204
<i>That ain't happening
That ain't happening</i>

694
00:52:52,304 --> 00:52:54,404
<i>Mother's already...</i>

695
00:53:04,537 --> 00:53:07,970
I was worried Dennis wasn't safe
around other monsters.

696
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:10,937
Now I don't even feel
like he's safe around you.

697
00:53:11,337 --> 00:53:13,704
- But I was just...
- What was it you said?

698
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:17,204
Human, monster, unicorn.
That it didn't matter?

699
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:19,370
Well, I just know his life would...

700
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:23,537
We'll have his birthday party here
on Wednesday. Then we're moving.

701
00:53:23,837 --> 00:53:26,837
Please, Mavey. Don't leave.

702
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,837
Maybe you've let humans
into your hotel, Dad.

703
00:53:29,937 --> 00:53:32,570
But I don't think
you've let them into your heart.

704
00:54:16,904 --> 00:54:19,770
I can do it. I can do it.

705
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,737
I'm a bat. I'm a bat.

706
00:54:23,337 --> 00:54:25,237
I'm a bat. I'm a bat. I'm a bat!

707
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:29,270
- Dennis? What are you doing, sweetie?
- Nothing.

708
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,370
Careful. Let me help you
down from there.

709
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,737
Are you getting excited
about your big party?

710
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:37,837
- I guess so.
- You know who's coming?

711
00:54:37,937 --> 00:54:41,604
Daddy's whole family.
Grandpa Mike and Grandma Linda.

712
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:45,370
All your cousins and aunts and uncles
who love you so much.

713
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,570
And then they're gonna be with us
when we move to California.

714
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:54,204
Mommy, are we going away
cebause I'm not a monster?

715
00:54:54,304 --> 00:54:57,837
What? No. Dennis, of course not. It's...

716
00:54:57,937 --> 00:55:00,370
It's just grown-up stuff.

717
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:03,170
Okay. But what about Papa Drac?

718
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,570
He's gonna be here all alone.

719
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,537
Papa Drac has to stay here
to run the hotel.

720
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:11,537
But he'll visit us. And we'll visit him.

721
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:15,404
- Can we call him every night?
- Sure.

722
00:55:20,504 --> 00:55:21,837
Awesome!

723
00:55:21,937 --> 00:55:24,404
Hello. We're here.

724
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:31,037
<i>The night brings Johnny's family here</i>

725
00:55:31,137 --> 00:55:36,170
<i>To take away all that Drac holds dear</i>

726
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,404
- Welcome, welcome.
- <i>Hide your feelings</i>

727
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:44,070
<i>Keep them all inside</i>

728
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:53,004
Dude, why do you wanna leave?
This place is out of control.

729
00:55:53,104 --> 00:55:56,404
- I don't wanna leave.
- All these awesome freakazoids!

730
00:55:56,504 --> 00:55:59,904
- So, who's the coolest monster?
- Kakie.

731
00:56:00,004 --> 00:56:03,170
- Kakie.
- Kakie. What a wussbag.

732
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:06,904
Isn't it nice to have
the whole family together?

733
00:56:07,004 --> 00:56:11,070
Mavis, do you have any cousins
or thingies in your family?

734
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,304
No. It's just been me and Dad.

735
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:16,337
I never did ask how you lost your mom.

736
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:19,070
She was killed by angry humans.

737
00:56:19,704 --> 00:56:22,370
<i>Awkward</i>

738
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,537
But there is my Grandpa Vlad.

739
00:56:24,637 --> 00:56:26,070
Oh, you have a grandpa?

740
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,304
Yeah. He'll be at the party.
I invited him.

741
00:56:29,404 --> 00:56:30,731
You invited him?

742
00:56:30,831 --> 00:56:35,170
Dad, he's never seen Dennis.
I wanted them to meet once before we go.

743
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:39,629
Sure. Great. Peachy. Good old Vlad.

744
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:42,048
Anybody have a wet wipe?

745
00:56:59,237 --> 00:57:03,744
Holy rabies.
He finally invites me to something.

746
00:57:03,844 --> 00:57:07,037
- He's got a grandkid?
- And he never told you?

747
00:57:07,137 --> 00:57:11,370
Easy, Bela. At least there's
another vampire in the family.

748
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,204
It's at a hotel? Fancy schmancy.

749
00:57:14,304 --> 00:57:17,511
Hotels are for humans!

750
00:57:22,437 --> 00:57:25,333
Bela, shut your blood hole.
Look what you started.

751
00:57:25,433 --> 00:57:26,825
Don't worry, gang.

752
00:57:26,925 --> 00:57:32,204
I raised my son to hate and kill and steal
the souls of humans like a good boy.

753
00:57:32,704 --> 00:57:35,737
Yes, Grandpa Vlad will be so happy

754
00:57:35,837 --> 00:57:40,632
when he sees the big masquerade party
Johnny and I have planned.

755
00:57:40,732 --> 00:57:42,537
What?

756
00:57:45,137 --> 00:57:48,370
- Play along. It's my dad.
- You have a dad? That's funny.

757
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:53,304
Listen to me. My dad cannot know
you're a human. Or any of your family.

758
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:55,504
What? But, Drac, I'm proud that we're...

759
00:57:55,604 --> 00:57:59,470
Or he'll steal your family's souls
and eat your backpack.

760
00:58:01,204 --> 00:58:06,715
That's right, gang. We're gonna make
the birthday a monster masquerade party.

761
00:58:06,815 --> 00:58:08,604
- Really?
- Oh, that's lovely.

762
00:58:08,704 --> 00:58:13,537
Sort of like a last hurrah before Dennis
gets to be with normal people.

763
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:15,969
I couldn't have said it better.

764
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:39,337
What do you think, Mavis?
I think I'm starting to like being creepy.

765
00:58:44,004 --> 00:58:46,942
You're lucky we don't
call the authorities.

766
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:51,504
Let's go, my hero. Cebause I'm Batman!

767
00:58:51,604 --> 00:58:54,370
Yes! To the Batmobile!

768
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:02,270
Got your butt kicked by a girl, Batman.

769
00:59:03,937 --> 00:59:07,570
Yeah. Whatever. I'm not about to cry.

770
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:13,384
Hotel Transylvania.

771
00:59:13,484 --> 00:59:17,070
I smell humans!

772
00:59:17,170 --> 00:59:19,804
Tear it down!

773
00:59:19,904 --> 00:59:24,437
Bela, we're in the outside world.
You're gonna smell humans.

774
00:59:24,537 --> 00:59:28,249
You know what? Just wait outside
for me. This is family stuff.

775
00:59:28,349 --> 00:59:31,770
You'll only get in the way.
I just wanna meet the little fanger.

776
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:34,987
- He should know his great-vampa.
- His what?

777
00:59:35,087 --> 00:59:39,070
Vampire grandpa. Come on.
That was obvious.

778
00:59:40,704 --> 00:59:42,727
Amazing party!

779
00:59:42,827 --> 00:59:45,404
So, what do you think?

780
00:59:45,504 --> 00:59:48,070
This is your vampire costume?
What are you, nuts?

781
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:51,386
I ordered it online. It was
the only place that delivered overnight.

782
00:59:51,486 --> 00:59:53,737
You look like you got
a baboon's butt on your head.

783
00:59:53,837 --> 00:59:57,810
Have you at least practiced your voice?
You can't just talk like a hippie.

784
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:01,970
- I'm not a hippie. I'm a slacker.
- Talk like a vampire.

785
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:07,337
My name is Count Jonafang.
I am a vampire.

786
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:11,084
Okay, vampires don't go around saying,
"I am a vampire."

787
01:00:11,184 --> 01:00:15,870
Sorry. I am Count Jonafang.

788
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:18,643
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry. I'm nervous.

789
01:00:18,743 --> 01:00:20,937
Yeah, listen,
if you think I don't like it,

790
01:00:21,037 --> 01:00:24,542
you definitely don't want to say...
in front of my father.

791
01:00:24,642 --> 01:00:27,970
- Sir, Master Kakie has arrived.
- Oh, hey.

792
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:32,407
Drac, this is Brandon, a.k.a. Kakie.
We got him for Dennis.

793
01:00:32,507 --> 01:00:34,904
- Hey, man.
- Nauseated to meet you.

794
01:00:35,004 --> 01:00:38,019
When does this happen?
I got a book fair in half an hour.

795
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:44,155
All right. Where's my vampson?

796
01:00:46,504 --> 01:00:49,833
Oh, please. Still has to make
a dramatic entrance.

797
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:52,290
Dad! Look at you!

798
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:54,670
So you run a hotel now?

799
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:58,504
From Prince of Darkness
to King of Room Service.

800
01:00:58,604 --> 01:01:00,954
Yes. So good to see you.

801
01:01:01,054 --> 01:01:03,952
I'll be right with you.

802
01:01:07,737 --> 01:01:11,470
Keep Vlad away
from the humans and Mavis.

803
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,238
I'm on it.

804
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,704
Oh, now that is a neat costume.

805
01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:19,997
These two smell funny.

806
01:01:20,097 --> 01:01:24,037
Oh, you're European.
It's called deodorant.

807
01:01:24,137 --> 01:01:27,266
Nothing like insulting
an entire continent, Linda.

808
01:01:27,366 --> 01:01:29,370
Hey, Count! How goes it? Frankenstein.

809
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:32,837
Actually, I'm technically Frankenstein's
monster. Frankenstein, he's the doctor...

810
01:01:32,937 --> 01:01:36,021
Would love to hear more. Call my people.

811
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:39,846
So, let me introduce you to some
of your son's other buddies.

812
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,304
- This is Murray.
- Please don't kill me!

813
01:01:43,404 --> 01:01:46,190
I mean, yo, V! What's up?

814
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:49,404
Talking toilet paper.
Well, that's a new one.

815
01:01:49,937 --> 01:01:52,670
All right! Where's the kid?
That's who I wanna meet.

816
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:54,837
Johnny!

817
01:01:56,904 --> 01:01:59,837
This is Dracula's son-in-law.

818
01:01:59,937 --> 01:02:03,875
I am Count Jonafang.

819
01:02:05,157 --> 01:02:09,170
...black sheep. Have you any wool?

820
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:13,637
What's that thing on your head?
Looks like my grandmother's boobies.

821
01:02:15,954 --> 01:02:18,137
Daddy, who's the man
with the funny face?

822
01:02:18,237 --> 01:02:20,888
- Is this the kid?
- It sure is.

823
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:23,549
Let me see those fangs.
What are you doin'?

824
01:02:23,649 --> 01:02:27,784
Oh, I just love him so much.
I want to hug him right in the fangs...

825
01:02:27,884 --> 01:02:29,522
that he has.

826
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:34,941
I repeat, lemme see those fangs.

827
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,977
Oh, he's a late fanger, just like you.

828
01:02:47,077 --> 01:02:50,404
Yes. Yes. Just like me.

829
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:54,470
The big shot here
was a little crybaby, all right.

830
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,890
- Yes, yes, I was.
- Used to pee in his bed.

831
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:58,204
Okay, Dad.

832
01:02:58,304 --> 01:03:01,170
We just need to scare
the fangs out of the kid.

833
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:02,676
Hare ha hangs?

834
01:03:02,776 --> 01:03:05,404
Yeah, it's what I did
for Mr. Tough Guy here.

835
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:10,570
First, you've got to possess something
the late fanger finds sweet and innocent.

836
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:14,004
Then you show them
what's what and... pop!

837
01:03:14,104 --> 01:03:18,204
Trust me. It'll scare the fangs
right out. Right, Drac?

838
01:03:18,304 --> 01:03:22,337
Seriously, guys, if I'm late for
the book fair, I'll miss the street fair.

839
01:03:22,937 --> 01:03:25,137
That's your guy.

840
01:03:25,237 --> 01:03:28,004
Possessed? But Dennis will be so upset.

841
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:32,292
Don't you get it? This is our ticket.
If it works for Denisovich, boom!

842
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:35,037
He's a vampire.
And you all get to stay here.

843
01:03:35,137 --> 01:03:37,759
All right. All right.

844
01:03:37,859 --> 01:03:39,537
- Capisce.
- Good call.

845
01:03:39,837 --> 01:03:42,137
Kids, everyone, have a seat.

846
01:03:42,237 --> 01:03:45,037
Dennis has a big surprise for you.

847
01:03:45,137 --> 01:03:49,770
The one and only Kakie,
The Cake Monster!

848
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,307
Hey, kids! It's me, Kakie!

849
01:03:53,807 --> 01:03:56,770
What a wonderful Kakie day it is!

850
01:03:56,870 --> 01:04:01,368
Now, I have a question.
Who here loves cake?

851
01:04:06,904 --> 01:04:09,021
Rise!

852
01:04:15,637 --> 01:04:18,704
Why am I floating?
Can I have the stage manager, please?

853
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:20,608
This isn't working for me.

854
01:04:26,837 --> 01:04:30,354
Scary, Denisovich?
You feeling anything? Any change?

855
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,099
Is Kakie okay?

856
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:38,210
I want all the cake.
Sharing is for cowards.

857
01:04:40,804 --> 01:04:44,170
I don't remember any of this
from the TV show.

858
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:47,109
I think I saw it on a Blu-ray disc,
bonus stuff.

859
01:04:47,209 --> 01:04:49,404
Wait, why is Grandpa Vlad up there?

860
01:04:55,770 --> 01:04:58,804
I'm scared, Papa.
What's happening to Kakie?

861
01:05:03,104 --> 01:05:06,670
You don't eat cake. Cake eat you!

862
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:08,534
No!

863
01:05:08,634 --> 01:05:10,704
Stop it!

864
01:05:12,670 --> 01:05:15,516
What just happened, man? I'm outta here.

865
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:18,970
None of these parents
better review this on Yelp.

866
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:20,207
Hey, what did you just do?

867
01:05:20,307 --> 01:05:23,170
A few more seconds and the kid's fangs
would've popped right out.

868
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:26,904
- I don't care. It's not worth it.
- What's not worth it?

869
01:05:27,004 --> 01:05:30,373
It was my last attempt to make
the boy a vampire, so you'd stay.

870
01:05:30,473 --> 01:05:33,587
By ruining his favorite thing?
How could you do that?

871
01:05:33,687 --> 01:05:36,204
- We were desperate.
- You were in on this?

872
01:05:36,304 --> 01:05:39,537
- Dennis won't be happy in my town.
- Dennis hasn't been there.

873
01:05:39,637 --> 01:05:44,270
<i>Now husband and wife
Feel the strain and the strife</i>

874
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,087
Shut up!

875
01:05:46,187 --> 01:05:48,731
Johnny, Dennis is not a monster.

876
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:53,537
- He likes avocado.
- 'Cause you don't let him eat anything fun.

877
01:05:53,637 --> 01:05:58,270
- I think Dennis just wants to be normal.
- Can we stop using the word "normal"?

878
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:00,404
Where we live now, he's normal.

879
01:06:00,504 --> 01:06:04,787
He is who he is.
And you can't change him, Dad.

880
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:10,837
- Dennis, where are you going?
- Away.

881
01:06:11,904 --> 01:06:16,241
But it's not safe out here by yourself.
I know a place where we can hide.

882
01:06:16,341 --> 01:06:18,437
Follow me.

883
01:06:23,937 --> 01:06:28,437
If you didn't stop me, my great-grandson
wouldn't have to be a wimp his whole life

884
01:06:28,537 --> 01:06:30,807
- like Schlumpy over here.
- A wimp?

885
01:06:30,907 --> 01:06:34,070
- Johnny, be cool.
- You wanna throw down, old man?

886
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:38,037
- Certified yellow belt since 1997.
- No!

887
01:06:38,137 --> 01:06:41,004
What's this now? You're not a vampire?

888
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:47,795
Of course he's human. He's our son.
You think we're monsters?

889
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:55,337
You! You let your daughter marry
a human and have a human kid?

890
01:06:55,437 --> 01:06:58,570
Why don't you just put a stake
through my heart.

891
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:02,204
We don't hate humans anymore,
and they don't hate us.

892
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:08,437
Humans?

893
01:07:09,187 --> 01:07:10,204
You're a fool.

894
01:07:10,304 --> 01:07:15,970
Your great-grandson is the sweetest,
kindest, most special boy I've ever met.

895
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:19,899
And if you can't give him the love
he deserves because he's half-human,

896
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:21,537
then you're the fool.

897
01:07:22,437 --> 01:07:24,504
Oh, Daddy.

898
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:29,884
- Hey, where is Dennis? Dennis!
- Dennis?

899
01:07:33,070 --> 01:07:36,004
Happy birthday, Dennis.
I made you a treat.

900
01:07:36,104 --> 01:07:37,278
Dead pigeon?

901
01:07:37,378 --> 01:07:41,004
Enjoy it. 'Cause once I graduate business
school and start running a company,

902
01:07:41,104 --> 01:07:44,070
you're not gonna get home-cooked
meals like this anymore.

903
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:47,704
I have to move away, Winnie.
To California.

904
01:07:47,804 --> 01:07:49,837
My mommy thinks I'm not happy here

905
01:07:49,937 --> 01:07:52,970
cebause I don't have hair
on my face like you.

906
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:55,237
I'm sorry I'm not a monster.

907
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:58,770
No, you are perfect.
You're the nicest boy I know.

908
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:03,404
- And I have 300 brothers.
- You're nice, too, Winnie.

909
01:08:07,237 --> 01:08:09,955
Well, well, well.

910
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:12,537
The little human and his pet.

911
01:08:12,637 --> 01:08:14,504
- Dennis!
- Denisovich!

912
01:08:14,604 --> 01:08:16,937
- He's not in the room.
- He's not by the pool.

913
01:08:17,437 --> 01:08:20,970
- He's not in this pot of soup.
- Where could he be?

914
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:24,137
I don't know why I ever invited you.

915
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,037
Stop squirming.

916
01:08:42,137 --> 01:08:46,131
- Why are you doing this?
- Because this is wrong.

917
01:08:46,231 --> 01:08:48,337
Why doesn't anybody get that?

918
01:08:48,437 --> 01:08:51,635
Humans don't belong with monsters.

919
01:08:51,735 --> 01:08:54,420
- You're wrong!
- I am not!

920
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:57,014
I am holding you hostage.

921
01:08:57,114 --> 01:09:02,604
And me and my crew are gonna tear
that human-hugging hotel to shreds.

922
01:09:02,704 --> 01:09:06,062
- You can't.
- Really? Why not?

923
01:09:06,262 --> 01:09:09,137
- Cebause...
- Cebause, why?

924
01:09:09,237 --> 01:09:12,120
Cebause it will make Papa Drac sad.

925
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:16,572
Sad. And what are you gonna do about it?

926
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:20,304
- I don't know.
- You know why you don't know?

927
01:09:20,404 --> 01:09:25,370
Cebause you're just a weak little boy.

928
01:09:55,337 --> 01:09:56,362
What was that?

929
01:09:56,637 --> 01:09:59,172
Dennis, we're coming.

930
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:03,796
- Are you okay, Winnie?
- Yes, my zing.

931
01:10:39,337 --> 01:10:42,304
- Dennis! There he is, right there.
- Dennis! Baby!

932
01:10:42,404 --> 01:10:45,670
- My big boy!
- Dennis, we were lookin' for ya.

933
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,337
There's his mean friends.

934
01:10:59,659 --> 01:11:02,104
This'll be fun.

935
01:12:02,287 --> 01:12:03,556
I didn't do that.

936
01:12:15,404 --> 01:12:17,837
- You rock, Dennis.
- He means Denisovich.

937
01:12:17,937 --> 01:12:19,463
Kakie rules!

938
01:12:29,937 --> 01:12:32,170
Dennis, I'm coming.

939
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,137
I knew all that practice would pay off.

940
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:05,619
That's right, you better fly away.

941
01:13:06,737 --> 01:13:12,170
Papa Drac, I'm a vampire
and a superhero. Am I cool now?

942
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:15,694
"Now"? Dennis, you were always cool.

943
01:13:15,794 --> 01:13:20,337
Human, vampire, unicorn,
you're perfect no matter what.

944
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:24,604
But since I'm a vampire,
can we stay here?

945
01:13:25,004 --> 01:13:26,170
Yes.

946
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:28,837
- All right! Yeah!
- All right!

947
01:13:30,454 --> 01:13:34,837
But you have to know, we're going
to visit you here every holiday.

948
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:37,170
That's fine.

949
01:13:52,537 --> 01:13:57,040
Don't ever come near me
or my family again.

950
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:02,110
No!

951
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:14,229
Daddy, you just saved a human.

952
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:19,087
All this pressure about
when the boy's fangs were coming out.

953
01:14:19,187 --> 01:14:23,420
Who cares?
Mine came out years ago! Look.

954
01:14:24,537 --> 01:14:27,470
Okay, Dad, put 'em back in
before we all barf.

955
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:31,522
Hey! Isn't it still somebody's birthday?

956
01:15:27,404 --> 01:15:29,970
Let me hear you sing!

957
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:32,847
I didn't do that.
